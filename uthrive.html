          During the Summer of 2022, I interned for a startup company called
          Uthrive. The main focus of the company is to help customers always use
          the right card for purchases to maximize their credit card rewards.
          During my internship, I was given various tasks such as redesigning
          the home screen of the mobile app, creating the UI for a new web
          extension, fixing problems with the website, and redesigning customer
          emails.

          <h1 class="page-subtitle">Problem:</h1>
          <p class="page-text-bold">
            Users don't want to see the same thing every time they open an app.
            Uthrive's previous home screen contained too little variation in
            what users saw on subsequent visits. This problem is all the more
            important in an app which emphasizes savings over time.
          </p>

          <p class="page-text">
            During my research, I tried to focus on improving the amount of
            detail users could see with their savings. I wanted to make it clear
            to customers how much they were saving and missing in rewards, with
            an easy to navigate and clean design.

          I created mockups for a new web extension which became the basis for
          the final design.
