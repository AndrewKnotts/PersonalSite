          During my last semester at Chapel Hill, I decided to make a videogame
          as an independent study. I ended up making a game called Azure Sense.
          The concept is that the boss of the game, (the big bad guy your
          character wants to defeat), is defeated right at the statrt! Your
          character must them journey home, finding a new purpose along the way.
          The main gameplay is talking to NPCs, exploring the world, and doing
          puzzles to progress.

        <p class="page-text">
          I created the game from scratch. Creating all of the artwork, music,
          dialogue and puzzles. I had to program all of the movement, dialogue,
          interactions, saving and loading states, weather effects, etc. Click
